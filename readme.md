# Expo Supabase Starter

You want to build a cross-platform expense splitting app (like Splitwise or Tricount) with additional features such as household investment tracking.

💻 Tech Stack
Frontend:

React Native + Expo for iOS and Android

React + Vite + Tailwind for Web

Backend:

Using Supabase as a backend-as-a-service (authentication, database, storage)

Folder Structure:

mobile/ — React Native app

web/ — Web app

shared/ — Shared logic: Supabase client, auth hooks, utils, models

🧩 Enhancements So Far
✅ Defined a scalable folder structure supporting both web and mobile

✅ Extracted shared logic into a shared/ directory

✅ Set up module path aliasing (@shared/*) for clean imports

✅ Discussed free-tier usage of Supabase and Vercel

✅ Explored options to expand to mobile using Expo

✅ Looked at GitHub starter repos for Supabase + Expo

✅ Clarified that the current setup doesn't yet have a custom backend (just Supabase)

## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive starter project for developing React Native and Expo applications with Supabase as the backend. It integrates various technologies such as Expo Router for navigation, Tailwind CSS for styling, React-Hook-Form for form handling, Zod for schema validation, and TypeScript for type safety. By leveraging these powerful tools, this starter template provides a robust foundation for building modern, scalable, and efficient mobile applications.
